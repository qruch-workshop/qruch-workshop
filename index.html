				<h3>QRUCH 1st Edition </h3>
				<P>This workshop is a follow-up to the BoF “Towards Hardware Agnostic Standards in Hybrid HPC/Quantum Computing” at ISC’24.</P>

				<P>Quantum Computing is not a completely  new topic: it was introduced in 1981 during a conference at MIT, but it really came under the spotlight as Peter Shor released his famous algorithm capable of breaking RSA encryption with tremendous acceleration. The domain remained a bit theoretical, studied in mathematical computer science, until a few years ago when actual Quantum Computers arrived on the market providing real (but yet limited) quantum compute resources. In the very last years, Quantum Computers gained more compute power, and they started to be deployed inside HPC centers while also becoming available on cloud based platforms. </P> 

				<P>As Quantum Computers leave the laboratories where they were designed and enter the HPC machine room, it becomes necessary to consider how they can be used to perform actual computation on real life use cases. As we are still in the NISQ era, and because HPC resources may help in using Quantum Computers efficiently, the hybrid HPC/QC naturally appeared, providing acceleration similarly to GPU previously.</P> 

				<P>This is not as easy as it seems. As the hardware becomes ready to be installed in computer rooms, the software stack has not evolved as fast. In particular, the required software stack to “glue” HPC and QC is not fully defined. Solutions exist and are provided by both research institutes and vendors, but they obey no standard. </P>

				<P>Current Quantum Computers are provided with a very simple software stack, usually a Python based framework, providing native access to the computing resources as well as a “mock device” providing emulation on standard CPU (and sometimes GPU) compute power. As we consider the integration inside the computer center, many topics, related to system integration as well as application integration are to be considered, such as:
				<ul>
					<li>authentication and accounting;</li>
					<li>job scheduling;</li>
					<li>benchmarking;</li> 
					<li>programming interfaces beyond Python</li>
					<li>mixing HPC and QC steps to perform actual HPC/QC hybridization</li>
				</ul></p>
				<P>This “half a day” workshop will address some of these topics as it aims to depict the available pieces of software that will help in integrating an actual quantum computer inside a machine room, making it available to end users.</P>

							<h2>Connecting Hardware and Software in Quantum Computing: The Quantum Device Management Interface (QDMI)</h2>
							<h3>Lukas Burgholzer (TUM))</h3>
							<p> This lightning talk will showcase an interface, called the Quantum Device Management Interface (QDMI), that addresses this problem by explicitly connecting the software and hardware developers, mediating between their competing interests. QDMI allows hardware platforms to provide their physical characteristics in a standardized way, and software tools to query that data to guide the compilation process accordingly. QDMI is publicly available as open source at 
https://github.com/Munich-Quantum-Software-Stack/QDMI.</p>

							<h2> SmartHPC.QC: evaluating the impact of malleability for HPC-QC integration<>h2>
							<h3>Gabriella Bettonte (gabriella.bettonte@e4company.com)</h3>
							<p>Today, HPC centers and quantum computers, as the number of quantum machines is dramatically lower than that of classical nodes. As jobs execute quantum kernels (or wait for their turn in a time-partitioned quantum resource), HPC nodes may be idle, thus occupying resources without performing anything. This phenomenon introduces inefficiencies in the overall HPC center performance. We suggest tackling the issue by adopting a more dynamic method to handle resource assignments, i.e., through malleability properties. With the SmartHPC.QC project (a collaboration between E4 Computer Engineering, Links Foundation, Università di Torino and CINECA), we aim to develop a malleable solution for allocating quantum resources in an HPC-QC pipeline.</p>

							<h2> Qunicorn: A Middleware for Unified Execution Across Heterogeneous Quantum Cloud Offerings.</h2>
							<h3>Lavinia Stiliadou (lavinia.stiliadou@iaas.uni-stuttgart.de)</h3>
							<p>Quantum computers are available via a variety of different quantum cloud offerings and quantum circuits can be implemented using different quantum programming languages. As a consequence, using a specific quantum programming language for implementing the application at hand can limit the set of compatible quantum cloud offerings and cause a vendor lock-in.  Therefore, we introduce the architecture for a unification middleware that facilitates accessing quantum computers available via different quantum cloud offerings by automatically translating between various quantum circuits and result formats</p>

							<h2>Programming models for hybrid HPC-QPU applications</h2>
							<h3> Santiago Nunez-Corrales (nunezco2@illinois.edu)</h3>
							<p> Programming quantum computers today still requires substantial knowledge of the physical basis of these devices. This creates a tall barrier for non-physicists to benefit from the additional computational resources QPUs provide and constrains the growth in number of successful final applications. When put in the perspective of integrating HPC and QPU resources, hybrid classical-quantum programming today seems not be poised to scale up alongside qubit counts, fault tolerance and utility-scale devices within the following decade. We will discuss new directions for quantum-only programming models inspired by four decades of parallel computing (including MPI, OpenMP and CUDA) where the main objective is to provide a uniform programming surface with much lower difficulty for newcomers</p>

							<h2>Heterogeneous quantum computing in C++ with Q-Pragma</h2>
							<h3> Océane Koska (oceane.koska@eviden.net) </h3>
							<p>Quantum computing offers a promising approach to solving complex computational problems. However, integrating quantum computing into existing high-performance computing (HPC) environments remains a significant challenge. The Q-Pragma programming framework aims to facilitate this integration by embedding quantum directives within C++ code, enabling the development of hybrid quantum-classical applications. This presentation will explore the architecture of Q-Pragma, its role in optimizing quantum-classical interactions, and its potential for enhancing computational performance.</p>
